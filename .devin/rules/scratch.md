description: Use the repo's gitignored scratch/ directory — not /tmp — for scratch work like pinned old releases, fixtures, and throwaway output
---

# Scratch work goes in `scratch/`

`scratch/` at the repo root is the canonical place for throwaway
artifacts: pinned old releases, test fixtures, downloaded files,
captured output, experiment directories.

- **Prefer it over `/tmp`/`$TMPDIR`.** Scratch inside the repo is easy
  to find, inspect, and diff — and cleanup is just removing the
  subdirectory you're done with (or all of `scratch/`).
- It's gitignored (`/scratch` in `.gitignore`), so nothing there lands
  in a commit by accident. `input/`, `output/`, and `docs-to-be-added/`
  are gitignored too, but `scratch/` is the convention — use it for
  anything new.
- Example: `fetch-servers`/`update` fixture trees and their installed
  output live under `scratch/` (e.g. `scratch/fake-releases`,
  `scratch/install-test`).
- `mktemp` inside a script is still fine for truly transient files —
  this rule targets work products you'd want to keep or inspect.
