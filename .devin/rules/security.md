description: Security review requirements when changing code, shell assets, or docs that touch the host/guest boundary, privilege, credentials, or security claims

# Security review

This project gives guests host reach (home mounts, SSH agent, published
ports) and guest-root conveniences (sudo/doas, `--cap-add ALL`) by
design — the trade-offs are spelled out in `docs/design/security.md`, not
accidental.

- **Think about security impact before committing.** Does the change add
  host surface, provision privilege, forward credentials, loosen a
  check, or weaken the VM/guest boundary? If yes, the security review is
  part of the same commit, not a follow-up.
- **Check both directions of the boundary.** Guest→host is the subtle
  one: host code trusting config, state, or output a guest can write is
  a confused deputy (the T6 trap — most findings C1–C12 are this shape).
  New host-trusted inputs need validation or a guest-unreachable
  location. This includes `sbin.distro/` shell assets — they run as
  PID 1 and root, so review them like the Rust, not like config.
- **Never commit secrets.** No keys, tokens, or credentials in code,
  tests, docs, or commit messages — and don't print them to logs.
- **Test hooks that touch trust must be opt-in per invocation.** Any
  seam that redirects downloads, swaps a verification input, or
  otherwise steers a privileged/integrity-critical operation for
  testing (fixture servers, alternate release roots, skip-check
  switches) must sit behind an explicit flag on that invocation —
  the `--dev` pattern — never an env var alone: a variable planted in
  a shell profile is a persistent, silent backdoor. Prefer local
  fixtures that keep the real checks running (version-bumped worktree
  builds, `python3 -m http.server` trees impersonating the real API)
  over weakening verification for the test. Env-only seams that merely
  select a *user*-privilege binary (`CONTAINER_CLI`) are PATH-
  equivalent — document them in the trade-off table, don't flag-gate
  them.
- **Security tests aim at decoys, never real host files.** A test that
  plants a symlink, or points a lock, write, chmod, delete, or
  privileged operation at a target, uses a stand-in it creates under a
  tempdir — a temp file, a fake binary — never `/etc/passwd`,
  `/bin/sh`, dotfiles, the real servers dir, or any other live file.
  If the defense under test regresses (symlink confinement, socket
  hygiene), the operation lands on whatever the test named: at best
  it hangs on an admin prompt, at worst it succeeds. Asserting on the
  decoy (content unchanged, still where it was) is the stronger test
  anyway. Literal system paths in pure path arithmetic (no filesystem
  access) are fine.
- **Document every new trade-off or shortcoming in `docs/design/security.md`.**
  New accepted risk → trade-off table entry; new violation/panic →
  findings table; new mitigation → note it under the risk it addresses.
- **Upstream findings follow `upstream-security.md` instead.** A
  suspected vulnerability in upstream code is parked on a `local/`
  branch — no details in shared branches, `docs/design/security.md`, or commit
  messages. (Linking an already-*public* upstream issue, as the findings
  table does, is fine.)
- **Docs may not oversell.** Anything marketed as "restricted",
  "hardened", "isolated", or similar must state next to the claim what
  it does *not* do (guest root, `set` reopening, `run --root`, etc.).
- **Reduction ≠ removal.** A flag that skips provisioning is a
  convenience boundary, not a wall — verify the protective code is
  absent or unexecuted (asset not mounted, not just an env check) when
  the claim is "cannot".
- **Keep `docs/design/security.md`'s checklist honest** — flip statuses as work
  lands, and add new entries when review uncovers a hole worth fixing
  later.
