# Commit Changes

1. Read `.devin/progress.md` if it exists — it records user prompts and work status since the last commit. Reflect anything still pending in your plan or the commit message.
2. If the changes complete a `docs/work/` item, delete its file and record the user-facing change under the `## X.Y.Z-dev` section of `CHANGELOG.md` (matching the dev version in `Cargo.toml`). User-facing work that was never a work item gets an entry directly.
3. Check if a commit template exists at `.templates/next-commit.txt`; otherwise use the base template at `.templates/next-commit-base.txt`.
4. Compose a commit message to `./next-commit.txt` following `.devin/rules/comment-file.md` (conventional-commit tag, subject, description, bullets).
5. Add the `Co-Authored-By` attribution trailer after a blank line as specified in `.devin/rules/attribution.md`.
   a. If the model is unknown or the user hasn't previously specified a model for this session, use `ask_user_question` to ask.
6. Run the commit command (requires user approval since it creates a commit):
   `git add -A && git commit -F ./next-commit.txt && mv ./next-commit.txt ./next-amend.txt`
7. After a successful commit, clear `.devin/progress.md` (truncate or delete it) — the logged work is now committed.
