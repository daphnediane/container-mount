#!/bin/sh
# Build the macOS installer .pkg, the cargo-binstall client tarball,
# the guest-server bundle, the CycloneDX SBOM, and their signatures.
# Orchestrator over the scripts/pkg/ helpers: name.sh decides artifact
# naming + provenance, worktree.sh materializes tag checkouts, build.sh
# compiles, collect.sh gathers binaries + inputs into the output dir,
# bundle.sh assembles and signs — source-free, so a worktree can go
# away once collecting is done. macOS only — needs cargo, jq,
# pkgbuild, and productbuild. Output lands in scratch/pkg/
# (gitignored). cargo-auditable and cargo-cyclonedx are recommended
# but optional here — build-pkg-signed.sh (the official release path)
# requires them.
#
# Assets produced (the names fetch-servers/update look for):
#   container-mount-<ver>.pkg / container-mount-<ver>-unsigned.pkg
#   container-mount-servers-<ver>.tar.gz          — both musl servers
#   container-mount-<triple>-v<ver>.tar.gz        — signed client + servers,
#                                                   with .sig (+ .asc)
#   container-mount-<triple>-v<ver>-unsigned.tar.gz  — unsigned variant
#
# Signing is auto-detected (docs/design/packaging.md):
#   --sign           require signing — fail when the identities are absent
#   --no-sign        force the -unsigned artifacts even with certs present
#   --skip-build     don't compile; collect.sh takes the existing
#                    target/release binaries (in-place only)
#   --allow-dirty    build the working tree even when signing — the
#                    artifacts get -<hash>/-dirty name mangling
#   --no-worktree    build in place but keep the tag+clean requirement
#                    (re-checked before bundling signs anything)
#   CODESIGN_IDENTITY  signs the container-mount binary (default: a
#                      "Developer ID Application" keychain identity, if
#                      present)
#   PKG_SIGN_IDENTITY  signs the .pkg (default: "Developer ID Installer")
#   NOTARY_PROFILE     notarytool keychain profile — when set, the signed
#                      pkg is notarized and stapled
#   GPG_KEY_ID         optional — an armored `gpg --detach-sign` .asc for
#                      the tarball, next to its detached code signature
# The musl servers are ELF — they can't carry a Mac signature; their
# integrity is the version stamp plus the release digest check.
#
# Provenance: a build whose tag exists on a clean checkout compiles
# inside a `git worktree` of `v<version>` under scratch/ — the source
# can't move mid-build — and prefers the tag's own helpers so a
# release is built by its tag's tooling. Signing without --allow-dirty
# additionally *requires* an anchor. Unanchored builds mangle the name
# too: `-<hash>` off-tag, `-dirty` on a dirty tree, `-unsigned` without
# certs — a canonical name always means tag content. Every build
# re-checks HEAD/version/status before bundling, catching a checkout
# moved mid-build.
